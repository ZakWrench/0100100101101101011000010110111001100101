def score(self, X, y, sample_weight=None):
        """
        Return the mean accuracy on the given test data and labels.

        In multi-label classification, this is the subset accuracy
        which is a harsh metric since you require for each sample that
        each label set be correctly predicted.

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : array-like of shape (n_samples, n_features)
            Test samples.

        y : array-like of shape (n_samples,) or (n_samples, n_outputs)
            True labels for `X`.

        sample_weight : array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None
            Sample weights.

        Returns
        -------
        score : float
            Mean accuracy of ``self.predict(X)`` w.r.t. `y`.
